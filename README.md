# The Phoenix Constitution

**A living, crowdsourced constitutional framework for a just, post-collapse democratic society.**

Born of broken promises and corrupted institutions, the Phoenix Constitution rises from the ashes of failed republics. This is not rebellionâ€”it is renewal. A charter of dignity, equity, transparency, and enduring resistance to tyranny.

We invite thinkers, reformers, survivors, and dreamers to help refine, interpret, and carry this forward.

## Core Principles
- Human dignity is non-negotiable.
- Power must be accountable, distributed, and limited by design.
- Justice must be enforceable, not symbolic.
- The state serves the people. Not the other way around.

## Status
Currently under active drafting. Full preamble and Articles Iâ€“III complete. Skeleton outline established for Articles IVâ€“XX.

## Contribution
