4. **Representation**  
   Meaningful participation in the creation, shaping, and review of laws and policies that affect one’s life.

## Section 4: Constitutional Adaptability

To ensure living governance, this Constitution shall undergo formal **public review every 20 years** through a Constitutional Convention of the People.

- This convention shall include elected delegates, subject-matter experts, and randomly selected civic jurors.  
- All proposed revisions shall be subject to **nationwide public referendum**.

## Section 5: Representation by Population

- Every **10,000 persons** shall elect one **Local Delegate**.

- Every **50 Local Delegates** shall collectively select one **National Representative**, subject to confirmation by public vote.  
  *→ See also: Article IV (Structure of Democratic Governance), Article XI (Administrative Districts)*

This system ensures proportional representation and prevents distortion by geography or legacy administrative boundaries.

## Section 6: Living Governance

- All subsequent Articles must interpret and implement these principles.  
- No law, policy, or government action shall contradict the rights and responsibilities set forth herein.
