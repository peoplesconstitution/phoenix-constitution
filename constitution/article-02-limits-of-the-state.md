## Section 2: Limits on State Power

The following actions are strictly prohibited. Any attempt to carry them out is a violation of this Constitution:

### 2.1 Surveillance Without Oversight
The state shall not conduct surveillance of any kind on persons, groups, or communities without legal justification, due process, and public oversight.

- Surveillance targeting persons based on race, religion, cultural identity, political opinion, or gender shall be considered an **assault on dignity** under Article I.
- Surveillance programs must be independently reviewable and publicly accountable.

---

### 2.2 Suppression of Dissent
The state may not punish, suppress, or inhibit lawful expression, dissent, or protest through direct force, surveillance, funding cuts, regulatory abuse, or indirect pressure.

- **Freedom of expression and dissent is protected from government interference**.
- **However, private individuals, organizations, and communities retain the right to respond socially, criticize, or disassociate from speech they oppose, provided such responses do not involve unlawful violence or abuse of state power.**

Use of paramilitary or military forces to suppress dissent is strictly prohibited.

---

### 2.3 Favoritism and Capture

The state shall not prioritize the interests of the wealthy, the influential, or the politically connected over those of the general public.

- Any official, agent, or institution that engages in favoritism toward persons of wealth, influence, or political power shall be subject to immediate investigation and, upon sufficient evidence, suspension from duty pending judicial review.
- Conviction of favoritism, influence peddling, or enabling oligarchic control shall result in permanent disqualification from holding any office of public trust, and may carry criminal penalties as defined by statute.

Attempts to shield, obscure, or excuse the undue influence of the affluent shall be treated as **complicity in constitutional violation**.

- Whistleblower protections shall extend to any individual exposing acts of favoritism, corruption, or oligarchic interference.

The era of oligarchy ends with the ratification of this Constitution.  
No wealth, position, legacy, or private interest shall stand above the dignity, rights, or will of the people.

*→ See also: Article XIV (Anti-Corruption and Competitive Integrity).*

### 2.4 Secrecy or Information Manipulation
Government agencies may not withhold, falsify, or obscure public information except to protect individual privacy or urgent national safety.

- Abuse of secrecy for political protection, cover-up of misconduct, or evasion of accountability is prohibited and shall trigger automatic independent investigation.

---

### 2.5 Avoidance of Accountability

Government officials, agents, and institutions must submit to all lawful investigations, civic petitions, judicial reviews, and public oversight.

- Any attempt to obstruct, delay, intimidate, retaliate against, or otherwise evade lawful accountability mechanisms shall be considered a **grave violation of the public trust**.

Consequences for such violations shall include:

- **Immediate suspension from authority** without administrative appeal,
- **Mandatory public disclosure** of allegations and evidence,
- **Judicial review within an expedited timeline**, enforced by an independent tribunal,  
- **Permanent disqualification** from holding any position of public trust upon conviction,
- **Criminal penalties**, including fines and imprisonment, proportionate to the severity of the violation.

Failure to respect lawful oversight is not a procedural error.  
It is an attack on democracy itself—and shall be met with full legal force.

No office, no badge, no title shall shield a violator from justice.

*→ See also: Article VII (Civic Oversight and Recall), Article III (Judicial Independence).*

## Section 3: Prohibition of Extrajudicial Detention

No person may be detained, arrested, or imprisoned outside the civilian legal system except under the following strict conditions:

- **Military Detention**: Military personnel convicted of crimes committed during active duty may be held in military detention facilities under independent civilian oversight.
  
- **Foreign Detention**: Individuals convicted of crimes in foreign jurisdictions may only be detained abroad if:  
  a) The jurisdiction does not violate international human rights standards, and  
  b) Detention will not expose the person to undue harm, retaliation, torture, or inhumane conditions.

- **No Secret Detention Sites**:  
  No person shall be detained in secret facilities, unofficial black sites, or facilities unaccounted for by public records.  
  All places of detention must be documented, accessible to independent monitors, and subject to public oversight.

Persons fleeing violence, persecution, or criminal syndicates shall not be extradited or remanded into unsafe custody.

## Section 4: Prison Rights and Abolition of For-Profit Prisons

### 4.1 Voluntary and Fairly Compensated Labor
No incarcerated person shall be forced to perform labor.

- Labor must be voluntary, compensated fairly according to national labor law, and shall not be used to offset incarceration costs, pay fines, or be garnished for fees.

### 4.2 End of For-Profit Incarceration
All for-profit prison models are abolished.

- Detention must never generate revenue or financial incentives for any private entity. All incarceration facilities must be non-commercial, publicly accountable, and independently reviewed.

## Section 5: Civic Defense and Policing Restraint

### 5.1 Prohibited Militarization

Military and paramilitary forces shall not be used for domestic law enforcement under any circumstance.

- Civil enforcement agencies must operate under civilian authority, using non-militarized protocols emphasizing de-escalation, proportionality, and the least force necessary.

---

### 5.2 Duty of Restraint and Accountability

Police and civic enforcement officers are obligated to uphold the constitutional rights of all persons.  
Every instance of force, detention, or civic authority use must be justifiable, documented, and subject to independent review.

To ensure true accountability:

- Investigations into allegations of misconduct, brutality, civil rights violations, corruption, or abuse of authority must be conducted by agencies **entirely independent** of the jurisdiction in which the accused officer or agent served.  
  **No self-investigation is permitted.**

- The practice of "internal exoneration" is constitutionally prohibited.  
  Outcomes must be determined by impartial entities with no political or institutional loyalty to the investigated agency.

- **Qualified immunity doctrines shall not apply** where violations of Articles I or II are alleged.

- Any attempt to relocate or reassign an officer, agent, or employee accused of constitutional violations to another jurisdiction without full disclosure and resolution of charges shall constitute **accessory after the fact** to the original offense.

  - Officials engaging in such protective relocation shall be subject to immediate suspension, judicial review, and, upon conviction, criminal penalties equivalent to those faced by the original offender.

- Civilian review boards with binding investigatory and disciplinary authority shall be established in every district, with appellate rights to national-level civilian commissions where local integrity is questioned.

The people shall have the right to petition for independent investigation where systemic corruption, intimidation, or failure to act is suspected.

No badge, no office, no institution stands above the law.

---

## Section 6: Enforcement and Consequences

This Article is enforceable by all branches of government and directly by the people.

- Judicial courts shall have authority to investigate, suspend, or remove any official or agency found in violation.
- Civilian watchdog commissions may initiate investigations, public hearings, or referendums in cases of systemic abuse.
- Citizens may file **Constitutional Violation Petitions** compelling court review under Article III.

The state must serve the people. When it fails, it must be reformed—not tolerated.
