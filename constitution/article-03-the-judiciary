# Article III â€“ The Judiciary

## Section 1: Purpose and Independence

The judiciary is established as an independent, co-equal branch of government, charged with upholding this Constitution, protecting the rights of the people, and serving as a check on all other powers.

- The judiciary shall have independent investigatory, enforcement, and administrative capabilities, distinct from the executive and legislative branches.
- No branch of government may interfere with judicial proceedings, investigations, decisions, or enforcement actions.
- Judicial enforcement arms shall be civilian in nature, non-militarized, and subject to public oversight.

---

## Section 2: Authority and Scope

The judiciary shall possess the authority to:

- Interpret and enforce all articles of this Constitution,
- Investigate constitutional violations by any person, organization, or government entity,
- Suspend, remove, or impose penalties on public officials found guilty of constitutional breaches,
- Issue injunctions, orders of protection, or emergency actions to prevent immediate harm to constitutional rights,
- Oversee the legality of elections, civic petitions, referenda, and public policy implementations,
- Arbitrate disputes between districts, agencies, and institutions where constitutional questions arise.

Its jurisdiction extends to all persons and all branches of government without exception.

---

## Section 3: Composition and Selection

Judicial authority shall be exercised through a multi-tiered system:

- **District Constitutional Courts** (trial level),
- **District Constitutional Appellate Courts** (first appellate level),
- **Regional Constitutional Courts** (second appellate and regional authority),
- **National Constitutional Tribunal** (final constitutional authority).

Judges at each level are selected through:

- Merit-based professional review,
- Civic jury vetting panels,
- Final public confirmation by direct democratic vote.

Lifetime appointments are prohibited.  
Judges shall serve staggered, renewable (or fixed) terms, each subject to Civic Review (Section 9).

## Section 3A: Proportional Judicial Representation

- **District Constitutional Courts**:  
  - One court per 100,000 residents, reviewed and adjusted every 10 years.

- **District Constitutional Appellate Courts**:  
  - One appellate court per five District Courts (approximately 500,000 residents), reviewed and adjusted based on case load and demographic shifts.

- **Regional Constitutional Courts**:  
  - One regional court per 5 million residents, with mandatory division if exceeding 7 million.

- **National Constitutional Tribunal**:  
  - 15 Justices maximum initially, scaling proportionally at approximately one Justice per 20 million residents.

All proportional adjustments shall occur during Constitutional Review cycles (Article X).  
Failure to maintain judicial proportionality constitutes a systemic violation of the right to access justice under Article I.

### Mechanism of Adjustment

- Every 10 years, a National Judicial Review Commission shall review population and caseload data.
- Adjustments to judicial infrastructure shall be mandatory if:
  - Any jurisdiction exceeds a 10% deviation above or below national standard ratios, or
  - Case processing times exceed constitutionally reasonable timeframes for two consecutive years.

In times of declared national emergency:

- The judiciary retains supreme authority over constitutional interpretation and enforcement.
- No executive order, legislative act, or emergency decree may override judicial review or suspend judicial function.

If the judiciary is unlawfully suspended, obstructed, or neutralized, it becomes the constitutional duty of the people, through civic councils and citizen militias, to restore lawful judicial operations by nonviolent means.

---

## Section 7: Binding Force of Constitutional Rulings

All rulings grounded in constitutional interpretation are binding upon:

- All branches of government,
- All levels of government,

Failure to comply with a constitutional ruling is itself a constitutional violation, triggering immediate suspension of the offending party and enforcement action.

---

## Section 8: Protection Against Judicial Capture

- No private entity, foreign government, religious institution, corporation, or political party may control, finance, coerce, or unduly influence any judicial body or officer.
- Anti-corruption and transparency standards for the judiciary shall be among the strictest applied to any branch of government.
