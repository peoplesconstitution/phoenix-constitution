# Preamble

We, the people, come together to affirm a new compact—one rooted in dignity, justice, and shared responsibility.  

We recognize that past systems, though founded on noble ideals, have too often been shaped by privilege, distorted by unchecked power, and captured by private interest. We acknowledge these failures—not to dwell in them, but to transcend them.

This Constitution is not an act of rebellion, but of renewal. It does not reject the pursuit of liberty, equity, or self-governance—it reclaims them.

We declare that all people, by their very existence, are deserving of voice, safety, and opportunity. That no law is just unless it serves the many. And that the strength of a society lies not in its wealth or might, but in its compassion, its fairness, and its courage to correct itself.

This living document is offered in hope, not fear. In unity, not division. In the belief that we are capable of better—and that we must build it together.

Here begins the Phoenix Constitution: a framework for a cooperative, democratic future, forged by the many, for the many.
